ðŸš­ AshToCash â€“ Quit Smoking, Track Your Savings ðŸ’°
AshToCash is a simple yet powerful web app that calculates how much money youâ€™ve saved by quitting smoking â€” built with love and purpose.

ðŸŒ± Why I Built This
More than 5 years ago, I quit smoking.

To stay motivated, I used to calculate how much money I was saving every day, week, and month. It gave me purpose and helped me track my progress.

Back then, I never imagined Iâ€™d become a web developer â€” but here I am today, building AshToCash, the tool I wish I had during my own journey.
